# ChessGame
Chess-engine designed and implemented by my friends, Cogo and Patrick, and I. Features AI opponent (using minimax), Lichess integration and multiplayer-on-LAN.

- Gamemodes can differ in starting position and/or rules of play
E.g. Horde plays the same way as regular chess, but white plays only as pawns.
